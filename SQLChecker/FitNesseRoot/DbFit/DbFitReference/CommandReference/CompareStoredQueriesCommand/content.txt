!2 !-Compare Stored Queries-!
'''!- Compare Stored Queries -!'''!- compares two previously stored query results. Specify symbol names as the first and second argument (without <<). The query structure must be listed in the second row. (Use -!'''!- Inspect Query -!'''!- to build it quickly if you do not want to type it.) Column structure is specified so that some columns can be ignored during comparison (just donâ€™t list them), and for the partial row-key mapping to work. Put a question mark after the column names that do not belong to the primary key to make the comparisons better. The comparison will print out all matching rows in green (-![[!-Figure 12-!][.DbFit.DbFitReference.CommandReference.CompareStoredQueriesCommand#figreferencecomparestored]]!-), and list rows that are in just one query with red (and fail the test if such rows exist). If some rows are matched partially, just by primary key, differences in individual value cells will also be shown and the test will fail. -!
