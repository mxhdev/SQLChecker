!3 Stored functions are treated like procs - just put ? in the result column header

!|Execute Procedure|ConcatenateF|
|first string|second string|?|
|Hello|World|Hello World|
|Ford|Prefect|Ford Prefect|

!3 ? does not have to appear on the end (although it is a good practice to put it there)

!|Execute Procedure|ConcatenateF|
|second string|?|first string|
|World|Hello World|Hello|
|Prefect|Ford Prefect|Ford|
