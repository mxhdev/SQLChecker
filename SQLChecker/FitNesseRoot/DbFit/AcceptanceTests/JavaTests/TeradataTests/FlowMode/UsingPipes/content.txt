Pipes (||) have special meaning both in FitNesse and Teradata - so they may break a query into several columns incorrectly: here is an example:

|note|Select :txt AS n, :txt || 'ABC' || :txt AS token|

To prevent the query from breaking, add !- !- -! and !- -! -! around it - FitNesse will parse it correctly:

|note|!-Select :txt AS n, :txt || 'ABC' || :txt AS token-!|

Here is a test example

!|set parameter|txt|1|

!|Query|!-Select :txt AS n, :txt || 'ABC' || :txt AS token-!|
|n|token|
|1|1ABC1|
